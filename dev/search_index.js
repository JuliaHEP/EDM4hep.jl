The user can register them with register(obj).\nNote that operations like register, setting  relationships (add_daughter,...), etc. will automatically create a new instance. The typical pattern is to overwrite the user variable with the new instance, e.g.:\np1 = MCParticle(...)\np1 = register(p1)\np1, d1 = add_daughter(p1, MCParticle(...))\nThe main goal for reading EDM4hep containers from a ROOT file is to obtain as result a StructArray(see StructArrays.jl documentation).
